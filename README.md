# MDC-100 Series of Codelabs
MDC 101 to 104.

Material Design is a system for building bold and beautiful digital products. By uniting style, branding, interaction, and motion under a consistent set of principles and components, product teams can realize their greatest design potential.

In Codelab MDC 101 I built a login page for the Shrine app that contains:

- An image of Shrine's logo
- The name of the app (Shrine)
- Two text fields, one for entering a username and the other for a password
- Two buttons ("Cancel" and "Next").

The login screen is purely to demonstrate design and does not process any usernames and passwords. Tapping Next will take you to the main app page.

In Codelab MDC 102 I built the home page for Shrine that contains:

- A top app bar
- A grid list full of products

In Codelab MDC 103 I update the home page and login design by modifying:

- Color
- Typography
- Elevation
- Shape
- Layout

In Codelab MDC 104 I change the UI in the Shrine app to a two-level presentation called a "backdrop". The backdrop includes a menu that lists selectable categories used to filter the products shown in the asymmetrical grid. In this codelab, I use the following Flutter components:

- Shape
- Motion

Tapping the menu button slides down the product display and animates the custom menu/logo icon, allowing you to select from different product categories.
Selecting a category slides the product page back into view. Tapping the white area at the top of the product page also slides the products down to reveal the menu.
