# MDC-100 Series of Codelabs
MDC 101 to 104.

Material Design is a system for building bold and beautiful digital products. By uniting style, branding, interaction, and motion under a consistent set of principles and components, product teams can realize their greatest design potential.

In Codelab MDC 101 I built a login page for the Shrine app that contains:

- An image of Shrine's logo
- The name of the app (Shrine)
- Two text fields, one for entering a username and the other for a password
- Two buttons ("Cancel" and "Next")

In Codelab MDC 102 I built the home page for Shrine that contains:

- A top app bar
- A grid list full of products
